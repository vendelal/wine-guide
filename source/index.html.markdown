# Wine Guide

Why should you buy French or Italian wines? Massive generalization: they're not as sweet and heavy as American wines. They're a bit more specific and refined and you can find really good food pairings with a lot of them.

Wines are labeled by region, not by grape variety, so you won't find "Cabernet Sauvignon" you'll find "Burgundy" which is a whole area of France.

# Reds

### Beaujolais

**What is it:** Southern part of Burgundy, Gamay grapes.

**Tastes like:** This wine will be light, spicy, pretty dry, and taste like cherries. Serve this chilled.

**With food:** It's good with chicken or other bland or light foods, but it won't hold up amazingly to fatty cheeses and heavier meats. It's good for before dinner with light snacks. Food makes it taste way better.

**Buy these:** Beaujolais-Villages or Beaujolais Crus

**Don't buy these:** Beaujolais Nouveau that's not from this year

### Burgundy/Bourgogne

**What is it:** A blend of grapes and wines from anywhere in Burgundy. If it's red, it'll be Pinot Noir. These are the cheaper Burgundies.

**Tastes like:** Round, light, fruity.

**With food:** Surprisingly good with fish. Also works with lighter meats like chicken, turkey, duck, lamb. But Pinot Noirs pair with a lot of food, they're a good restaurant choice.

**Buy these:** Weirdly anyone outside of France can also use the label "Burgundy" on their wines. As long as you can see that it's actually from France, any bottle will probably be good enough.

### C√¥tes du Rh√¥ne

**What is it:** Southeastern France. Warmer = more alcohol. Grenache, Syrah, Cinsault, and Mourv√®dre grapes.

**Tastes like:** Heavier, full-bodied, fruity, ripe red berries, spicy.

**With food:** Goes with poultry, cheese.

**Buy these:** "C√¥tes du Rh√¥ne" = max 3 years old. "Ch√¢teauneuf-du-Pape" = 5+ years old.

### Bordeaux

**What is it:** Southwestern coast of France. Blends of Merlot and Cabernet Sauvignon. They're usually named "Ch√¢teau" something.

**Tastes like:** Gravelly, blue/black fruits, smooth.

**With food:** Beef and lamb, served with mushrooms. Fish, or just on its own.

**Buy these:** Anything that says "Appellation Bordeaux Contr√¥l√©e" should be relatively inexpensive but very drinkable and delicious. One of my favorite types of wine and a safe bet.

Pro tip: Blends with more Merlot in them will taste more fruity and are better younger. Blends with more Cabernet Sauvignon will be better after a few years. If you can see whether it's from the "right bank" it'll have more Merlot, if it's from the "left bank" it'll have more Cabernet.

### Chianti

**What is it:** Wines from Tuscany made from Sangiovese grapes.

**Tastes like:** Spicy, light, high acid, cherry, strawberry, roasted pepper, tomato.

**With food:** Pizza! Tomato sauces, Italian food. (Although if you're getting pizza consider just having a Peroni instead üòâ) Chianti is also a great alternative when you're having steak if it's a heavier and fruitier variety.

**Similar wines:** Montepulciano, Brunello di Montalcino, Vernaccia di San Gimignano, Carmignano

**Buy these:** It's a bit tricky to buy a good one, if you can splurge and get a Chianti Classico it'll be significantly better.

### Rioja

**What is it:** Northern Spanish wine that tends to be similar in characteristic to French Bordeaux. Made from Tampranillo and Grenacha grapes.

**Buy these:** Here's a list of the best Riojas
