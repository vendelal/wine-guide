            section_content: Less expensive Barolos can be really tasty and sound fancy.

            section_content: This wine will be light, spicy, pretty dry, and taste like cherries. Serve this chilled.
          - section_title: With food
            section_content: It's good with chicken or other bland or light foods, but it won't hold up amazingly to fatty cheeses and heavier meats. It's good for before dinner with light snacks. Food makes it taste way better.

        sections:
          - section_title: What is it
            section_content: Southwestern coast of France. Blends of Merlot and Cabernet Sauvignon. They're usually named "Ch√¢teau" something.

          - section_title: Buy these
            section_content: Anything that says "Appellation Bordeaux Contr√¥l√©e" should be relatively inexpensive but very drinkable and delicious. One of my favorite types of wine and a safe bet.
          - section_title: Pro tip
            section_content: Blends with more Merlot in them will taste more fruity and are better younger. Blends with more Cabernet Sauvignon will be better after a few years. If you can see whether it's from the "right bank" it'll have more Merlot, if it's from the "left bank" it'll have more Cabernet.

      - title: Burgundy/Bourgogne
        sections:
          - section_title: What is it
            section_content: A blend of grapes and wines from anywhere in Burgundy. If it's red, it'll be Pinot Noir. These are the cheaper Burgundies.
          - section_title: Tastes like
            section_content: Round, light, fruity.
          - section_title: With food
            section_content: Surprisingly good with fish. Also works with lighter meats like chicken, turkey, duck, lamb. But Pinot Noirs pair with a lot of food, they're a good restaurant choice.
          - section_title: Buy these
            section_content: Weirdly anyone outside of France can also use the label "Burgundy" on their wines. As long as you can see that it's actually from France, any bottle will probably be good enough.

      - title: Cabernet Sauvignon
        sections:
          - section_title: What is it
            section_content: A natural cross between Cabernet Franc and Sauvignon Blanc from Bordeaux, France. Ages well.

            section_content: For French cabs, look for ones from the M√©doc in Bordeaux. For American cabs, look for ones from Napa Valley. For Australian cabs look for ones from the Southern parts. For Chilean cabs look for ones from Aconcagua, Maipo, Cachapoal and Colchagua Valleys.
          - section_title: Don't buy these
            section_content: Try to look up the vineyards, especially from California. If it's a massive production, try to avoid them. They can give you bad hangovers because there are a lot of fillers and other questionable materials in the wines. They also tend to run their vineyards in ways that are very harmful to the environment.

            section_content: Pizza! Tomato sauces, Italian food. (Although if you're getting pizza consider just having a Peroni instead üòâ) Chianti is also a great alternative when you're having steak if it's a heavier and fruitier variety.

          - section_title: Buy these
            section_content: Sancerre's are French sauvignon blancs. You can be reasonably safe buying a cheap sauvignon blanc.

      - title: Pinot Grigio
        sections:
          - section_title: What is it
            section_content: The most popular white wine in Italy, and second most popular in the US.
          - section_title: Tastes like
            section_content: Lemons, limes, green apples and honeysuckle
          - section_title: Don't buy these
            section_content: Because it's so popular, it has resulted in some really bad mass production of this variety. Try to look up the vineyard, especially if it's at a cheaper price point, to see how big the production is. If it's huge, you might want to skip it.

      - title: Muscadet
        sections:
          - section_title: What is it
            section_content: A white wine from the Loire Valley of France that is made with Melon de Bourgogne grapes.

            section_content: Oysters! Seafood, citrus-y vinaigrettes
          - section_title: Buy these
            section_content: If you spend a little more money on a Muscadet and it's 3+ years old, you may get one that has been aged sur lie (it might even say it in the label) which means it's been aged with its suspended yeast particles. This creates a richer flavor almost like fresh bread or preserved lemons.

      - title: Moscato
        sections:
          - section_title: What is it
            section_content: Sweet Italian wines made from Muscat Blanc, one of the oldest grape varieties in the world. Tends to be lower in alcohol.

          - section_title: Buy these
            section_content: It's a good time to buy Chablis from the past few years because climate change has made growing Chardonnay grapes in Burgundy easier. If you can splurge ($25+) on a bottle labelled Premier (1er) Cru Chablis AOP, you'll get a wine from a vineyard that's in the top 15% of quality locations in the region.

      - title: Chardonnay
        sections:
          - section_title: What is it
            section_content: An extremely popular white grape from France that's now grown everywhere. Often aged in oak and was most popular in the 90s, people seem to hate oak nowadays.
          - section_title: Tastes like
            section_content: Medium dry, yellow apple, pineapple, vanilla, butter.

          - section_title: Buy these
            section_content: If you're not into oaky flavors (toast, vanilla, butter, baking spices) in your wine, try going for a Chablis, or ask the person in the wine store for an unoaked Chardonnay. They're super crispy and more similar to Sauvignon Blanc or Pinot Grigio.

      - title: Pouilly-Fuiss√©
        sections:
          - section_title: What is it
            section_content: Wine from a subregion of Burgundy called M√¢connais. It's 100% Chardonnay.

          - section_title: Note
            section_content: Pouilly-Fuiss√© has quickly become one of my favorite white wines and is usually my go-to at restaurants. I find it's usually a bit more complex and flavorful than going with a Sauvignon Blanc or Chablis, but still seems to be a safe bet.

      - title: Ros√©
        sections:
          - section_title: General
            section_content: |
              If I'm buying a ros√© from a store with a very standard selection, or even a grocery store, I always choose one that's from Provence, France. They are lighter in color and tend to be that refreshing, crisp, dry summer drink you want.

              If I'm buying a ros√© from a store with a more curated selection and where the staff seem to know a bit about wine, I tend to go for darker ros√©s because they might have more flavor imparted from the skins or other red wines. Gamay or Pinot Noir ros√©s have both resulted in interesting drinking experiences for me.

      - title: Orange Wine
        sections:
          - section_title: What is it
            section_content: Orange wines are white wines that are made in the style of red wines. Red wines are red because they're pressed with their red skins (all grapes are pretty much white on the inside). Orange wines have been pressed with the skins of white grapes. If you're a real wine-o you wouldn't call these "orange wines" you would say "skin contact."
          - section_title: Note
            section_content: These wines aren't new, but are just now becoming very popular. Unless you're at a restaurant that seems to have a very well curated wine program, picking the orange wine might not be your best bet. It could just be that they put the cheapest one they could find on their menu to seem cool.

      - title: Natural Wine
        sections:
          - section_title: What is it
            section_content: Natural wine is an extremely loose term that's meant to mean "hasn't been messed with." This can take many forms. A lot of the time it means that the farming to produce the grapes was organic or even biodynamic.
          - section_title: Characteristics
            section_content: A characteristic of these wines can often be called "funky." This can mean it's a flavor that's different from traditional wines and might smell and taste more fermented, yeasty, or just unique somehow.
          - section_title: Note
            section_content: They're fun if you want to try something new, sometimes have really cool label artwork, and make for a great tasting experience even if you don't necessarily find your new favorite.
